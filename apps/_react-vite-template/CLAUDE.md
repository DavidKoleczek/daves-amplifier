## App Development

You must follow best practices such that there are no ESLint errors. The configuration is found in the following files:

@eslint.config.js

- You should not try to start the development server, assume the user already has it running.
- Do not reinvent components that already exist in shadcn. However, you **must** pause and ask the user to add the component for you. The components will be placed in `src/components/ui`
- Do not place any new content into the `src/lib` directory as it was generated by shadcn and is gitignored.

## TypeScript ESLint, and Prettier Reminders

- **Always verify with both IDE diagnostics AND `make check`**
  - The IDE ESLint may show false positives due to caching or type inference limitations
- When importing TypeScript types, use `import type` syntax to comply with `verbatimModuleSyntax`:
- Don't mark functions as `async` unless they contain `await` expressions
- For setTimeout and other callbacks, use regular functions instead of async
